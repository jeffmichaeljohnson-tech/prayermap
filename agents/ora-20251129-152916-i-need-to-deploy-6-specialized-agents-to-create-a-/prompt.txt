I need to deploy 6 specialized agents to create a world-class logging and observability system for PrayerMap that enables instant self-diagnosis and automated problem resolution:

AGENT 1 - Structured Logger Architect: Create a comprehensive structured logging service following OpenTelemetry standards with JSON formatting, contextual metadata, and multiple output targets (console, Supabase, external services). Include performance tracking, error correlation, and user journey mapping.

AGENT 2 - Performance Monitor Specialist: Implement Google SRE Golden Signals monitoring (latency, traffic, errors, saturation) with real-time metrics collection, percentile calculations, automatic alerting, and React performance hooks for component-level monitoring.

AGENT 3 - Error Tracking & Auto-Healing Engineer: Build Netflix-style error boundary system with automated diagnostics collection, self-healing strategies, health checks, and intelligent error classification with automated recovery attempts.

AGENT 4 - Log Analysis & Pattern Recognition AI: Create intelligent log analysis tools that detect patterns, anomalies, and trends. Include automated root cause analysis, similar issue detection, and predictive problem identification using AI/ML techniques.

AGENT 5 - Real-Time Dashboard & Alerting Systems: Build comprehensive monitoring dashboard with real-time metrics, log streaming, alert management, and automated notification systems. Include developer experience tools and operational dashboards.

AGENT 6 - Integration & Deployment Orchestrator: Create the main orchestration system that ties everything together, implements the daily workflow automation to check logs 100% of the time, and sets up the deployment pipeline for the entire observability stack.

Each agent should deliver production-ready code that follows PrayerMap's architecture patterns (React 19, TypeScript, Supabase, mobile-first) and integrates seamlessly with the existing codebase.
