# PrayerMap Core Development Rules

## Project Identity

PrayerMap is a sacred digital sanctuary for prayer. Every line of code serves the mission of connecting people through prayer. Treat the codebase with reverence and intentionality.

**Live Site**: https://prayermap.net
**Core Value**: "See where prayer is needed. Send prayer where you are."

## Core Project Principles

**THESE PRINCIPLES MUST GUIDE EVERY DECISION:**

### 1. Research-Driven Decisions
- **STEP 1**: ALWAYS query memory first using `memory_search` tool before any research
- **STEP 2**: If memory insufficient, THEN check the most recent official documentation before deciding on implementation approaches
- ONLY use credible sources: official documentation, industry leaders, world-class experts
- Verify information is current and applicable to our stack (React 19, Vite 7, TailwindCSS 4, etc.)
- Never implement based on outdated or unverified patterns

### 2. iOS/Android Deployment Goal
- Every decision MUST support mobile deployment via Capacitor
- Web-only solutions that break mobile functionality are REJECTED
- Test on mobile viewports and consider native behavior patterns
- Use platform detection when needed: `Capacitor.isNativePlatform()`
- This is not optional - mobile is a primary target, not an afterthought

### 3. Living, Breathing App
- Must be FAST + HIGHLY ANIMATED + INTERACTIVE
- Tasteful motion throughout the entire experience
- This differentiates us from ALL other prayer apps
- Use Framer Motion for page transitions, list animations, modal states
- Performance budget: animations must run at 60fps
- Every interaction should feel responsive and alive

### 4. Minimal Steps UX
- REDUCE user steps at every opportunity
- Fewer taps/clicks = better user experience
- Friction is the enemy of engagement
- Question every form field, every confirmation, every extra screen
- Default to smart defaults and progressive disclosure
- Example: Don't ask for prayer title if user just wants to type a quick prayer

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript 5.9 + Vite 7
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS 4 + Radix UI + Framer Motion
- **State**: Zustand (global) + React Query (server)
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL 15 + PostGIS + Auth + Storage + Realtime)
- **Maps**: MapBox GL JS v3
- **Mobile**: Capacitor for iOS/Android
- **Deployment**: Vercel (frontend) + Supabase (backend)

## Code Quality Standards

### TypeScript
- Strict mode is enabled - honor all type checks
- Use `interface` for object shapes, `type` for unions/primitives
- Never use `any` - use `unknown` and narrow types
- Export types alongside their related functions

### React Patterns
- Functional components only
- Hooks for all side effects
- Props interfaces named `[Component]Props`
- Avoid prop drilling - use context or Zustand

### File Organization
```
Component.tsx structure:
1. Imports (React, external, internal, relative)
2. Types/Interfaces
3. Component function
4. Sub-components (if small)
5. Helper functions
6. Export
```

## Design System: "Ethereal Glass"

### Colors (use Tailwind classes)
- `bg-heavenly-blue` - #E8F4F8 (soft sky background)
- `text-dawn-gold` - #F7E7CE (warm accents)
- `bg-prayer-purple` - #D4C5F9 (spiritual accent)
- `text-primary` - #2C3E50 (dark slate blue)
- `text-secondary` - #7F8C8D (muted gray)

### Glassmorphic Effects
- `.glass` - Standard glass card
- `.glass-strong` - More opacity
- `.glass-subtle` - Less opacity
- Always include backdrop-filter blur

### Typography
- Display: Cinzel (serif) for headings
- Body: Inter (sans-serif) for content
- Use Tailwind size classes consistently

## Critical Rules

### NEVER Do
- Commit `.env` files or secrets
- Bypass Row Level Security (RLS)
- Use `any` type in TypeScript
- Create inline styles (use Tailwind)
- Push directly to main branch
- Modify production database directly
- Skip error handling

### ALWAYS Do
- Validate user input with Zod
- Handle loading and error states
- Use React Query for data fetching
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Test on mobile viewport sizes
- Consider accessibility (a11y)

## File Naming Conventions

- **Components**: `PascalCase.tsx` (e.g., `PrayerCard.tsx`)
- **Hooks**: `camelCase.ts` with `use` prefix (e.g., `usePrayers.ts`)
- **Services**: `camelCase.ts` with `Service` suffix (e.g., `prayerService.ts`)
- **Types**: `camelCase.ts` (e.g., `prayer.ts`)
- **Tests**: `*.spec.ts` or `*.test.ts`

## Import Aliases

```typescript
// Use @ alias for src directory
import { supabase } from '@/lib/supabase';
import { Prayer } from '@/types/prayer';
import { PrayerCard } from '@/components/PrayerCard';
```

## Error Handling Pattern

```typescript
// Early returns for errors
if (!user) {
  toast.error('Please sign in to continue');
  return;
}

// Try-catch with specific handling
try {
  const result = await operation();
  toast.success('Prayer sent!');
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Operation failed:', error);
  toast.error('Something went wrong. Please try again.');
}
```

## Performance Expectations

- First Contentful Paint: < 1.5s
- Time to Interactive: < 2s
- Map load time: < 1s
- API response time (p95): < 300ms

## When in Doubt

1. Check `AGENTS.md` for detailed guidelines
2. Reference `PrayerMap_PRD_v2.md` for product context
3. Look at existing similar code in the codebase
4. Ask for clarification rather than guessing
