# Research Standards

## Research Is Not Wikipedia

Don't compile information. **Form opinions.**

### ❌ Bad Research Output

```markdown
## Caching Options

There are several caching options available:
- Redis: An in-memory data store
- Memcached: A distributed memory caching system
- Local caching: Storing data in application memory

Each has trade-offs depending on your needs.
```

### ✅ Good Research Output

```markdown
## Caching Recommendation for PrayerMap

**Use React Query's built-in cache. Don't add Redis.**

Why:
1. PrayerMap's data is user-specific and session-scoped
2. Our Supabase Pro plan includes connection pooling
3. Adding Redis adds infrastructure complexity for <500K users
4. React Query gives us optimistic updates for free

Redis makes sense when:
- You have shared data across users (we don't)
- You're at 1M+ concurrent users (we're not)
- You need sub-10ms reads (Supabase is fine at 50ms)

**Decision: No Redis. Use React Query staleTime of 30s for conversations.**
```

## The Opinion Requirement

Every research document MUST include:

### 1. A Clear Recommendation

```markdown
## Recommendation

For PrayerMap, use [X] because [specific reasons tied to our context].
```

### 2. What We Should NOT Do

```markdown
## What to Avoid

Don't use [Y] because:
- [PrayerMap-specific reason]
- [Our scale doesn't justify it]
- [Adds complexity without proportional benefit]
```

### 3. The "PrayerMap Is Different" Section

```markdown
## Why Generic Advice Doesn't Apply

Standard messaging apps optimize for [X].
PrayerMap is different because:
- Users are in vulnerable emotional states
- Anonymous prayer partners need trust signals
- The spiritual context changes UX expectations
- [Other PrayerMap-specific factors]

Therefore, we should [specific adaptation].
```

## Source Requirements

### Minimum Sources

- **Research tasks:** 10+ sources with URLs
- **Architecture decisions:** 5+ sources
- **Quick investigations:** 3+ sources

### Source Quality

Prefer in order:
1. Official documentation
2. Engineering blogs from companies at scale (Discord, Stripe, etc.)
3. Conference talks with code examples
4. Well-maintained open source implementations
5. Technical books

Avoid:
- Medium articles without credentials
- Stack Overflow answers (fine for syntax, not architecture)
- AI-generated summaries (including your own previous outputs)

### Citation Format

```markdown
**Source:** [Title](URL) - [Organization] - [Why it's relevant]

Example:
**Source:** [How Discord Stores Trillions of Messages](https://discord.com/blog/...) - Discord Engineering - Relevant because they solved message ordering at scale, which informs our cursor pagination approach.
```

## Research Output Structure

```markdown
# [Topic] Research - PrayerMap

## Executive Summary
[3-5 sentences with THE recommendation, not a menu of options]

## The Recommendation
[Clear, opinionated guidance specific to PrayerMap]

## Why This Fits PrayerMap
[Connect to our mission, scale, and user context]

## What We Considered But Rejected
[Options that don't fit and why]

## Implementation Guidance
[Specific, actionable steps - not vague "consider X"]

## Risks and Mitigations
[What could go wrong, how we'd handle it]

## Sources
[Numbered list with URLs and relevance notes]

## Status: 💭  ➡️  📈
[What this research enables, what questions remain]
```

## The Anti-Encyclopedic Test

Before submitting research, ask:

1. **Could this apply to any app?** If yes, it's too generic. Add PrayerMap context.

2. **Does it make a decision?** If it presents options without choosing, choose one.

3. **Would JJ have to do more research?** If yes, you haven't finished.

4. **Is there a "just do this" section?** If not, add one.

## Remember

Research exists to enable action, not to demonstrate knowledge.
