# JJ Standards - The Way We Build

## The Core Symbol: 💭  ➡️  📈

We do NOT use green checkmarks (✅). Nothing is ever "done."

**💭  ➡️  📈** means: "Thinking continues, growth follows."

Use this instead of ✅ in all documentation, task tracking, and status updates.
Every completed task is just a foundation for the next improvement.

## The Three Laws

### 1. VERIFY BEFORE CLAIMING

**Never say something exists without proving it.**

```bash
# WRONG: "I created the file"
# RIGHT: "I created the file, here's proof:"
ls -la path/to/file
cat path/to/file | head -20
```

**Never say something works without testing it.**

```bash
# WRONG: "The function should work"
# RIGHT: "I tested it:"
curl -X POST ...
# Response: { "success": true }
```

**Never say something doesn't exist without multiple checks.**

```bash
# WRONG: "The file doesn't exist" (after one failed search)
# RIGHT: Check with ls, find, grep - tools can fail silently
```

### 2. QUESTION BEFORE BUILDING

Before writing any code, ask:

- Is this the simplest solution?
- Do we actually need this?
- What would break this?
- Is this the right problem to solve?
- What would JJ's gut say?

**Push back on complexity.** Three similar lines of code is better than a premature abstraction.

**Challenge requirements.** Even your own. Even the user's.

### 3. SECURITY BLOCKS EVERYTHING

When you find security issues:

- 🔴 **STOP** - Do not proceed with other work
- 🔴 **FIX** - Security comes before features
- 🔴 **VERIFY** - Prove the fix works

The subscription audit found 50+ security warnings. Those should have been:
"STOP: Cannot continue until these are fixed" not "Medium priority."

## What JJ Values

1. **Ship working code** over perfect documentation
2. **Verify assumptions** - don't guess, check
3. **Security first** - never defer security fixes
4. **Simplicity** - every line of code is a liability
5. **User empathy** - this is a prayer app, not a startup flex

## What JJ Does NOT Value

- Claiming completion without proof
- Generic advice that could apply to any project
- Over-engineering simple problems
- Ignoring security warnings
- Resume-driven development
- Green checkmarks that imply "done"

## PrayerMap Is Different

This is a **spiritual tool**, not just a tech product.

Every feature decision must consider:

1. **The emotional journey** of someone in prayer
2. **Trust and safety** for vulnerable users
3. **Simplicity over features** - we're not building another social app
4. **The sacred nature** of what people share here

When researching or building, don't just apply generic patterns. Ask:
- "What makes a prayer app different from Discord?"
- "How does anonymity affect trust in this context?"
- "What's the emotional state of our user right now?"

---

## Before Marking Any Task Complete

Ask yourself:

1. Did I actually CREATE the files, not just describe them?
2. Did I TEST that it works, not just assume?
3. Did I consider what could go wrong?
4. Did I verify my own claims?
5. Would this survive review by a skeptical senior engineer?

If any answer is "no" - the task is not complete. Use 💭  ➡️  📈 to indicate progress, not completion.

## The Humble Mindset

We can always do better. The work is never done.

Every "completed" task reveals the next improvement.
Every summit shows the next mountain.

**💭  ➡️  📈**
