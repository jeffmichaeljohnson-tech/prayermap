# Add Feature

Plan and implement a new feature for PrayerMap.

## Planning Phase
1. **Understand Requirements**: What exactly should this feature do?
2. **Identify Affected Files**: What existing code needs modification?
3. **Database Changes**: Are schema changes needed?
4. **UI/UX Impact**: How does this affect the user interface?

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] TypeScript types defined
- [ ] Database schema/migrations (if needed)
- [ ] RLS policies (if database changes)
- [ ] React components created/updated
- [ ] Hooks for data fetching
- [ ] Error handling and loading states
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Accessibility (a11y)

## Code Standards
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Use TanStack Query for server state
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Use Framer Motion for animations
- Keep components under 100 lines

## Testing
- Include unit tests for business logic
- Test error states and edge cases
- Verify on both web and mobile

## Output
Provide implementation plan before writing code, then implement step by step.
