# AI-AGENTS.md - Autonomous Software Development Excellence

> **The definitive guide to autonomous software development through intelligent multi-agent coordination.** This document outlines how to achieve 150+ hours of development work in 7 hours while maintaining world-class quality standards through coordinated AI agents.

> **🎯 MANDATORY FOUNDATION:** Read [ARTICLE.md](./ARTICLE.md) first - it contains the Autonomous Excellence Manifesto that governs every aspect of this methodology. Then reference [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) for project context.

## 🎯 The Mission: Transforming Software Development

**We are building a new way of building software** - one where AI agents work in coordinated parallel tracks to achieve enterprise-grade velocity while maintaining world-class quality standards.

### Why This Revolutionary Approach Matters

**The Traditional Software Development Problem:**
- **Human Bottleneck**: Even senior developers max out at ~40 productive hours/week working sequentially
- **Context Switching**: Constant interruption between research, implementation, testing, documentation
- **Quality vs Speed Trade-offs**: Pressure to ship fast often compromises long-term excellence
- **Knowledge Silos**: Expertise trapped in individual minds, difficult to scale or transfer
- **Inconsistent Standards**: Quality varies by person, mood, and time pressure

**The Autonomous Excellence Solution:**
- **Parallel Intelligence**: 8-15 specialized agents working simultaneously on different aspects
- **Continuous Quality**: Every piece of work validated against world-class standards before integration
- **Institutional Memory**: All decisions, patterns, and learnings captured for continuous improvement  
- **Human Amplification**: Humans focus on strategy and vision while agents handle execution excellence

### Core Mission Principles

**1. Autonomous Excellence**
- Software development quality that matches or exceeds the best companies on Earth (Anthropic, Stripe, Google)
- Research-driven decisions backed by official documentation and industry leaders
- Premium infrastructure approach - no corners cut, best tools and practices

**2. Parallel Velocity** 
- 150+ hours of development work completed in 7 hours through intelligent coordination
- Multiple work streams progressing simultaneously with dependency management
- Milestone-based delivery over timeline-based (quality determines completion)

**3. Quality Without Compromise**
- 85%+ quality target for all deliverables
- 90%+ accuracy requirement for all agent work
- 95%+ documentation coverage with proper citations
- Mobile-first development (works perfectly on iOS, Android, and web)

**4. Human-AI Partnership**
- Eliminate human bottlenecks through automation
- Amplify human strategic thinking and decision-making
- Preserve human creativity and vision while scaling execution
- Build systems that make human developers more effective, not replaceable

**The Transformation:**
```
Traditional: 1 Human → 40 hours/week → Variable quality → Knowledge silos
Autonomous: 1 Human + 8-15 AI Agents → 150+ hours/week → Consistent excellence → Institutional memory
```

**This is not about replacing human developers - it's about creating a new category of software development capability where human strategic thinking is amplified by autonomous execution excellence.**

- **3+ distinct steps** required for task completion
- **Multiple technology domains** involved (frontend + backend + mobile)
- **Research + implementation phases** needed (research-first principle)
- **Multiple file types** must be modified
- **Performance optimization** requiring multiple approaches
- **User requests** containing: "fix all", "implement X", "optimize", "deploy"

**Autonomous Excellence Triggers:**
- **Research-intensive tasks** requiring primary source analysis
- **World-class benchmarking** against industry leaders (Anthropic, Stripe, Google)
- **Premium infrastructure deployment** (no corners cut)
- **Quality gate enforcement** (85%+ quality, 90%+ accuracy)
- **Mobile-first development** (iOS + Android + web simultaneously)
- **Memory system integration** (document all decisions for future reference)

**Speed-First Execution Criteria:**
- **Parallel track potential** - 150+ hours achievable in 7 hours
- **Independent work streams** with clear dependencies
- **Milestone-based delivery** over timeline-based
- **Elimination of human bottlenecks** through automation

### Research-First Coordination Pattern (From ARTICLE.md)

**🚨 MANDATORY Research Protocol Implementation:**
```typescript
// Example: User requests "Add video prayer feature"
// Autonomous Excellence deployment:

🚨 STEP 0: MEMORY SEARCH FIRST (MANDATORY)
Research Agent: Query project memory BEFORE any external research
memory_search("video prayer implementation")
memory_search("prayer memorial lines video")
memory_search("real-time video features")
memory_search("past video implementation failures")
memory_search("supabase video storage decisions")

1. RESEARCH PHASE (Identify World Leaders - After Memory Search)
Research Agent: "Study Zoom, Loom, TikTok video implementation patterns"
- Primary sources: Official API docs, architecture blogs
- Credibility verification: Tier 1 (official) > Tier 2 (industry) > Tier 3 (experts)
- Mobile constraints: iOS/Android native capabilities
- Living Map impact: How does video affect real-time prayer witnessing?

2. PARALLEL EXECUTION PHASE (Speed-First)
Director: Deploys 6 agents simultaneously based on memory + research findings
├── Backend Agent: Supabase video storage + compression (depends: memory + research)
├── Frontend Agent: React video UI + animations (depends: memory + research)
├── Mobile Agent: Capacitor camera integration (depends: memory + research)
├── Security Agent: Privacy compliance for spiritual content (parallel)
├── Performance Agent: Video optimization for mobile (depends: backend)
└── Testing Agent: E2E video flow testing (depends: all)

3. LIVING MAP VALIDATION (Before Quality Gates)
ALL agents must verify:
- Does video enhance real-time prayer witnessing?
- Do video prayers appear live on the map for other users?
- Are video memorial lines created instantly when someone responds?
- Does video maintain <2 second real-time performance?

4. QUALITY GATE VALIDATION
All agents must pass before integration:
- TypeScript strict mode: 100%
- Mobile compatibility: iOS 14+, Android 10+
- Performance: 60fps video, <2s upload, <2s real-time updates
- Security: RLS policies, no exposed storage URLs
- Living Map: Real-time behavior verified with multiple users
- Documentation: 95%+ coverage with implementation notes

5. MEMORY INTEGRATION
Archivist Agent: Documents decisions for future reference
- Why Supabase over AWS S3? (integration simplicity)
- Video compression ratios chosen? (mobile data usage)
- Privacy controls implemented? (spiritual content protection)
- Real-time performance impact? (Living Map requirements)
- Lessons learned for future video features?
```

## 🔄 Agent Coordination Patterns

### State Management Decision Tree
**Clear guidance for avoiding conflicts:**

```typescript
// Decision Tree for State Management:

// 1. LOCAL COMPONENT STATE (React useState/useReducer)
// ✅ Use for: Form inputs, toggle states, temporary UI state
const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);
const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState('');

// 2. SERVER STATE (React Query)
// ✅ Use for: All data from Supabase, API calls, caching
const { data: prayers } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['prayers', filters],
  queryFn: () => prayerService.getPrayers(filters)
});

// 3. GLOBAL CLIENT STATE (Zustand)
// ✅ Use for: Auth state, user preferences, cross-component UI state
const { user, signIn, signOut } = useAuthStore();
const { theme, language, setTheme } = usePreferencesStore();

// ❌ DON'T use Context for: Server state, frequently changing state
// ❌ DON'T use Zustand for: Data from APIs, temporary component state
```

### Performance Coordination
**Shared performance thresholds all agents must meet:**

```typescript
// PERFORMANCE_THRESHOLDS - Single source of truth
export const PERFORMANCE_THRESHOLDS = {
  // Core Web Vitals
  FIRST_CONTENTFUL_PAINT: 1500,    // ms
  TIME_TO_INTERACTIVE: 2000,       // ms
  LARGEST_CONTENTFUL_PAINT: 2500,  // ms
  CUMULATIVE_LAYOUT_SHIFT: 0.1,    // score
  
  // Component Performance
  COMPONENT_RENDER: 50,             // ms
  ANIMATION_FRAME: 16.67,           // ms (60fps)
  
  // Bundle Size
  MAIN_BUNDLE: 500,                 // KB gzipped
  VENDOR_BUNDLE: 200,               // KB gzipped
};
```

### Error Handling Coordination
**Standardized error handling across all agents:**

```typescript
// Standard error handling pattern
try {
  const result = await operation();
  logSuccess('operation.success', { result });
  return result;
} catch (error) {
  // 1. Log structured error
  logError('operation.failed', {
    error: error.message,
    operation: 'operation_name',
    context: additionalContext
  });
  
  // 2. Attempt auto-recovery
  const recovered = await attemptRecovery(error);
  if (recovered) {
    logInfo('operation.recovered', { strategy: recovered });
    return recovered;
  }
  
  // 3. Escalate with context
  throw new Error(`Operation failed: ${error.message}`);
}
```

### Quality Gate Enforcement
**All agents must validate deliverables against these gates:**

```typescript
// Quality gates that must pass before delivery
const QUALITY_GATES = {
  typescript: () => runTypeScript(),      // Must pass: npx tsc --noEmit
  linting: () => runESLint(),             // Must pass: npm run lint
  testing: () => runTests(),              // Must pass: npm test
  performance: () => checkLighthouse(),   // Must score: 90+
  mobile: () => testMobileCompat(),       // Must work: iOS + Android
  accessibility: () => runAxeCore(),      // Must pass: WCAG 2.1 AA
};

// All gates must pass before agent marks task complete
const validateDeliverable = async () => {
  const results = await Promise.all(
    Object.entries(QUALITY_GATES).map(async ([name, gate]) => {
      try {
        await gate();
        return { gate: name, status: 'pass' };
      } catch (error) {
        return { gate: name, status: 'fail', error };
      }
    })
  );
  
  const failures = results.filter(r => r.status === 'fail');
  if (failures.length > 0) {
    throw new Error(`Quality gates failed: ${failures.map(f => f.gate).join(', ')}`);
  }
};
```

## 🎯 Implementation Standards

### Code Quality Requirements
**Non-negotiable standards for all agents:**

```typescript
// TypeScript Standards
interface ComponentProps {  // Use interface over type for objects
  title: string;
  onClick: () => void;
  isLoading?: boolean;     // Optional props with ?
}

// React Component Structure
export function PrayerCard({ title, onClick, isLoading = false }: ComponentProps) {
  // 1. Hooks first
  const [expanded, setExpanded] = useState(false);
  const { data } = useQuery(['prayer', id]);
  
  // 2. Event handlers
  const handleExpand = useCallback(() => {
    setExpanded(!expanded);
  }, [expanded]);
  
  // 3. Render
  return (
    <motion.div
      initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
      animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
      transition={{ duration: 0.3 }}
    >
      {/* Component JSX */}
    </motion.div>
  );
}

// 4. Subcomponents (if small)
function PrayerActions() { /* ... */ }

// 5. Helper functions
function formatPrayerTime(date: Date): string { /* ... */ }
```

### Mobile-First Implementation
**Every feature must work flawlessly on mobile:**

```typescript
// Platform detection pattern
import { Capacitor } from '@capacitor/core';

const useNativeFeature = () => {
  if (Capacitor.isNativePlatform()) {
    // Use native implementation
    return useNativeCameraPlugin();
  } else {
    // Web fallback
    return useWebCameraAPI();
  }
};

// Touch-friendly design
const MOBILE_STANDARDS = {
  MIN_TOUCH_TARGET: 44,        // pixels
  SAFE_AREA_INSETS: true,      // Handle notches
  HAPTIC_FEEDBACK: true,       // On user actions
  GESTURE_SUPPORT: true,       // Swipe, pinch, etc.
  OFFLINE_FIRST: true,         // Work without network
};
```

### Animation Implementation
**Consistent, performant animations:**

```typescript
// Animation configuration
const ANIMATION_CONFIG = {
  TIMING: {
    FAST: 150,      // Hover states
    NORMAL: 300,    // Default transitions
    SLOW: 500,      // Complex animations
  },
  EASING: {
    OUT: 'easeOut',
    SPRING: { type: 'spring', stiffness: 300, damping: 30 }
  }
};

// Standard animation variants
const fadeInUp = {
  initial: { opacity: 0, y: 20 },
  animate: { opacity: 1, y: 0 },
  exit: { opacity: 0, y: -20 }
};

// Usage
<motion.div
  variants={fadeInUp}
  initial="initial"
  animate="animate"
  exit="exit"
  transition={{ duration: ANIMATION_CONFIG.TIMING.NORMAL / 1000 }}
>
  {content}
</motion.div>
```

## 📊 Agent Success Metrics

### Performance Tracking
**How success is measured across all agents:**

```typescript
// Agent performance metrics
const AGENT_SUCCESS_METRICS = {
  research_agent: {
    accuracy: 0.90,           // 90%+ source verification accuracy
    response_time: 300,       // seconds
    citations: 1.0,           // All claims cited
  },
  frontend_agent: {
    performance: 90,          // Lighthouse score
    bundle_size: 500,         // KB gzipped
    test_coverage: 0.80,      // 80%+ component coverage
  },
  mobile_agent: {
    compatibility: 1.0,       // 100% iOS/Android compatibility
    app_store_compliance: 1.0, // 100% guideline compliance
    native_features: 0.95,    // 95%+ feature parity
  },
  backend_agent: {
    query_performance: 1000,  // ms average
    rls_coverage: 1.0,        // 100% RLS policy coverage
    uptime: 0.999,           // 99.9% availability
  },
  testing_agent: {
    coverage: 0.90,          // 90%+ critical flow coverage
    automation: 0.95,        // 95% automated testing
    regression_detection: 1.0, // 100% regression catch rate
  }
};
```

### Memory Integration Requirements
**How agents coordinate and share information:**

```typescript
// Memory logging for important decisions
/*
MEMORY LOG:
Topic: State management architecture decision
Context: User authentication state needs global access
Decision: Use Zustand for auth state, React Query for user data
Reasoning: 
  - Zustand: Lightweight, TypeScript-friendly
  - React Query: Handles server state caching automatically
  - Avoids prop drilling and Context re-render issues
Alternatives: Redux (too heavy), Context (performance issues)
Agent: Frontend Agent
Date: 2024-11-30
*/
```

### Agent Handoff Protocol
```typescript
// When passing work between agents
interface AgentHandoff {
  from_agent: string;
  to_agent: string;
  completed_tasks: string[];
  changes_made: { file: string; description: string }[];
  open_questions: string[];
  next_steps: string[];
  quality_gates_passed: boolean;
}

// Example handoff
const handoff: AgentHandoff = {
  from_agent: 'frontend',
  to_agent: 'mobile',
  completed_tasks: [
    'Implemented PrayerCard component with animations',
    'Added responsive design for mobile screens',
    'Created TypeScript interfaces'
  ],
  changes_made: [
    { file: 'src/components/PrayerCard.tsx', description: 'New prayer card component' },
    { file: 'src/types/prayer.ts', description: 'Updated Prayer interface' }
  ],
  open_questions: [
    'Should haptic feedback be on card tap or prayer action?'
  ],
  next_steps: [
    'Test PrayerCard component on iOS and Android',
    'Integrate native haptic feedback',
    'Verify touch target sizes meet mobile standards'
  ],
  quality_gates_passed: true
};
