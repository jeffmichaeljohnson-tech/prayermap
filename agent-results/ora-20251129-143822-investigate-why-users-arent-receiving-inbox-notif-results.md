# Ora Agent Report: investigate-why-users-arent-receiving-inbox-notif

**Agent ID**: ora-20251129-143822-investigate-why-users-arent-receiving-inbox-notif  
**Execution Time**: Sat Nov 29 14:38:22 EST 2025  
**Status**: Completed  

## Mission
Investigate why users aren't receiving inbox notifications when others pray for their requests

## Analysis Approach
Based on the prompt, this agent would:

1. **Analyze the Problem**: Break down the specific issue or task
2. **Research Context**: Review relevant code, documentation, and patterns
3. **Identify Solutions**: Propose specific fixes or implementations
4. **Validate Approach**: Ensure solutions align with project standards
5. **Document Results**: Provide clear, actionable recommendations

## Simulated Investigation
*Note: This is a simulated agent response. In a full Ora deployment, this would contain actual analysis results.*

### Key Findings
- Agent successfully received and processed the prompt
- Context analysis indicates this relates to PrayerMap functionality
- Investigation parameters align with project requirements

### Recommended Actions
1. Execute deeper investigation using the full agent deployment system
2. Run: `npm run agents:deploy` for comprehensive multi-agent analysis
3. Review specific technical components based on the prompt context

### Next Steps
- Deploy specialized agents for detailed analysis
- Implement recommended fixes with proper testing
- Validate solutions against project quality standards

## Technical Context
**Project**: PrayerMap - Location-based spiritual platform  
**Stack**: React 18, TypeScript, Supabase, MapBox  
**Standards**: 85%+ quality, 90%+ accuracy (per ARTICLE.md)
